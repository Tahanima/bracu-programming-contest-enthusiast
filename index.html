                    <h1>BRACU <sub>Programming Contest Enthusiasts</sub></h1>
                    <p>When I started competitive programming in BRAC University, I didn't know about the seniors who represented BRAC University in various programming contests. I did not know about their accomplishments or the struggles they went through. Most importantly, I did not know something like "programming contest" exists. So, this is my sincere attempt to document as much as possible regarding the accomplishments and struggles of the contestants of BRACU along with some useful resources for preparation. I hope that the current and future contestants of BRACU will take pride in the accomplishments of their seniors and push themselves out of their comfort zones to bring fame and glory for this community.</p>

                    <p>Competitive programming is a very recognized sport worldwide and so, a simple google search will result into tons of resources.
