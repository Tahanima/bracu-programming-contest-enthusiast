                    <h1>Motivation<sub>-101</sub></h1>
                    <p>Each one of us involved, has faced a lot of hurdles and has been able to get through them during our competitive programming journey. There were moments which have motivated us a lot and there were moments as well when we thought we were very incompetent. Sharing some words from few alumni of the competitive programming community of BRAC University (while keeping the person's identity anonymous) so that the current and future contestants get motivated and encouraged.</p>

                        <p>When I started solving competitive programming problems, it was pretty late. I mean, I started after I've completed CSE 221 (Algorithms course). One of my batch mates once said to me to start solving but at that point, I felt problem solving requires the implementation of a lot of algorithms so I should start after I'm done with CSE 221. That was a pretty bad decision from my end since a lot of problems can be solved without the knowledge of algorithms. Then, shaping my brain to think critically was a major challenge since our education system is such that we are only confined to studies. I literally struggled a lot. There were times when it felt like problem solving is not for me, I was better being a "good student". I mean at least at the end of a semester I get certain rewards in the disguise of good "CGPA". Problem solving has both its pros and cons. And the cons does not matter to be honest. This is because it is possibly the only thing in my life which gives me immense joy even when I fail since I know I'm learning.</p>

                        <p>I got more WAs than ACs in this short life of mine. Its like getting things wrong is in my blood. On a serious note, it is a very bad experience to get a WA after spending two or more days on a problem. I have many such problems which I have tried to solve for a very long time and still was not able to solve. I have kept those noted down so that when I may get the time I will try them once again. But getting that AC feels so great. To be honest, it's very easy to get demotivated really fast. It can sometimes be frustrating even. But it's worth it. That feeling of accomplishment is totally worth it. I can sometimes be very addicted towards such problems which I cannot solve. It feels like I can solve it but not being able to solve it really bugs me a lot. And I guess that is what keeps me motivated. The failure to solve a problem of my standard keeps me motivated. There are also such problems which are simply said to be out of my league. Those give me the cringes and the inspiration to google about that topic, to learn more. But honestly the biggest thing that motivates me to solve problems is my dream that one day Bangladesh will have Programming as a part of its curriculum and the students will be solving programming problems. I am not a good problem solver, I am slow, I have very less solves. But I am trying. I know I can never be the best but it's ok. Problem solving is fun. I intend on keeping it as a hobby.</p>
